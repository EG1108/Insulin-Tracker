         <h2>Our Science</h2>
      <p>InsuLogger calculates your bolus insulin dose based on specific carbohydrates you expect to eat during each meal and your blood sugar reading. </p>
        <p>What is a bolus insulin dose? Bolus insulin is the medical term for the rapid-acting insulin that quickly lowers your blood sugar before you eat your meal, so the delicious carbs in your food don't raise your blood sugar too much and cause any ill side-effects or symptoms. We use your specific data such as your carb-to-insulin ratio and insulin sensitivity to calculate the most accurate bolus dose information for you.  </p>
        <h2>About Diabetes</h2>
        <h5>Who gets diabetes and why?</h5>

        <p>Understand that your are not alone! 8% of the population lives with diabetes and new technology makes it easier than ever to live an easy and healthy lifestyle with diabetes. Diabetes occurs when insulin-producing cells in the pancreas do not function as they should.
